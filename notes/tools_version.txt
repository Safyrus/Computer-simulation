    - 0.0.1.0 [2020/03/12]:
                            # Creation of the first version of the OS. Contains an initialization phase followed by a main phase.
                            # 2 function about 16bit integers can be used, one to compare them and the other to add them.
                            # 1 function(SYST_FCT1_END) allows you to return to the location of the call.
                            + Beginning of memory allocation to have more advanced functions (able to use a stack).
                            + Added comments to help understand the code.


    - 0.0.1.1 [2020/03/12]:
                            ~ Fixed 16 bit addition: fixed a bug during the carry. the addition of the lower part did not occur.


    - 0.0.2.0 [2020/03/12]:
                            # Added 2 functions (prologue and epilogue) to make custom functions.
                            + Added version number and author in the program.
                            + Added 3 custom functions (use for testing, they just put values in registers).
                            - Remove the old main function.
                            + Added new main function to test custom functions.
                            ~ Fixed function stack adress.


    - 0.0.2.1 [2020/03/12]:
                            ~ Fixed prologue function: now calls epilogue if stack is full.
                            ~ Renamed SYST_FCT_PROLOGUE in SYST_FCT1_PROLOGUE and SYST_FCT_EPILOGUE in SYST_FCT1_EPILOGUE.
                            + Added a recursive function to fill the stack.
                            ~ Fixed prolog function: will now go to the end of the stack and won't leave 2 bytes out.


    - 0.0.3.0 [2020/03/14]:
                            + Added a 16bit substraction function.
                            ~ Optimised a little bit the 16bit add function.
                            - Removed test functions.
                            ~ Changed main function to test 16bit sub.

                            + Added a location in RAM where to find devices
                            # Added a function to get device adress
                            # Added a function to get device length
                            # Added a function to transmit data to any devices(driver need to be install)
                            + Added a driver for keyboard
                        Variable stack:

                            # Added a function to push a value in the stack
                            # Added a function to pop a value in the stack
                            # Added a function to push general registers in the stack
                            # Added a function to pop general registers in the stack
                        Graphics:
                            # Added 2 functions to draw a pixel to the screen(one of them will be remove soon)

                            # Added a function to draw characters to the screen
                            + Added locations in RAM to store graphical data(like screen location, cursor position, etc)
                    Modification:
                        Fix:
                            ~ Fixed functions that use the flag register to jump

                            ~ separate the code in muliple files
                            ~ Renamed "function one call" by "subroutine"
                            ~ move subroutine in a separated file
